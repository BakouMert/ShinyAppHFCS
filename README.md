# ShinyAppHFCS
 This repository harbours the code that created the R Shiny application to visualise inequalities in Belgium using the newest HFCS data
 You can see the result at https://beconblog.quarto.pub/posts/OngelijkheidHFCS/ 
Sadly I had to remove the dataset the code loads, as I remembered I cannot share the data as they are proprietory. So the code provided here will not work. I will update the R script such that the code provided will work on the full HFCS data, once the user has gained access to it (contact ECB)
